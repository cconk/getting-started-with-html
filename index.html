  <h1>My Stage 0 Notes</h1><br>
<h2>HTML</h2>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to process communication across the Internet.<br>
HTTP is the protocol used to communicate between my computer and servers.
The world wide web is collection of HTML Documents. Major components of the Internet include the following:
<p>My computer/browser<br>
  The Internet<br>
  Servers<br>
  HTTP
</p>
<h2>Inline vs Block Elements</h2>
HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. 
<h2>1 - What a Web Page is</h2>
<p>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</p>

<h2>2 - How Coding Works</h2>
<p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
<br>I'm learning to code!
<br>look like this:
<br>I'm <b>learning</b> to code!</p>

<h2>3 - Computers are Stupid</h2
>Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax"). 

<h2>4 - Programmers Can't Remember Everything</h2>
There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up. 

<h2>5 - Basic HTML Vocabulary</h2>
You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.
<p>• Tag: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag.<br>
	• Element: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br>
	• Attribute: This is a property of an HTML element.
